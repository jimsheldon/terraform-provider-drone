# terraform-provider-drone

A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) provider for configuring [Drone](https://drone.io).

This is a rewrite of [Lucretius/terraform-provider-drone](https://github.com/Lucretius/terraform-provider-drone) which is no longer maintained.

This work is in the very initial stages. Pull requests with contributions are most welcome!
